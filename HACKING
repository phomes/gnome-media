THIS IS A STABLE BRANCH OF GNOME-MEDIA

Commits here only allowed by gnome-media maintainers or translators.

Diffs should be done with -U2 option.
The style of code should be the same as the rest of the code in the program:
IE for gnome-cd or CDDBSlave tab setting of 8, braces at the end of lines. etc.

The HACKING file for gnome-libs has some good information for hacking
requirements on gnome-media.

Please pass non-translation patches through bugzilla.
