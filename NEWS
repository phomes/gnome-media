--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 1.2.3:

	* Only configure ALSA when the user asks for it
	* use xml-i18n-tools for .desktop translations

	* gmix changes
	  * Don't apply changes in preferences immediately. Wait until
	    the user has clicked 'apply'
	  * set gnome-volume.png to be the window icon, if it exists
	  * improve the error message displayed if the mixer device
	    cannot be opened
	  * Prefer the card name to the mixer name, in the mixer display

	* grecord changes
	  * Reset the recording time when a new record session is started
	  * Search the full path for the sox and gmix binaries

	* tcd changes
	  * Make the GUI insensitive before exiting
	  * Only open the cdrom device temporarily for each action
	  * Try much harder to load a font. This fixes a segfault.
	  * Create a CORBA interface for gtcd, to ensure that only one
	    copy is running at one time
	  * Recognize data tracks
	  * Allow keybindings to be saved as a modifier+key pair,
	    rather than just a numeric key code
	  * Several code cleanups and segfault fixes

New in 1.2.2:

	Documentation fixes. The docs weren't being included in the
	tarballs.

New in 1.2.1:

	Scrollkeeper support.

New in 1.2.0:

	Slightly fewer bug fixes than last time. New program, grecord.
	TCD now supports socks servers. Hopefully fixed a random segfault in
	gtcd. Default icons set.

New in 1.0.52:

	Yet more bug fixes. GMix shows icons and labels, and restores levels
	on startup. Some kernel-warning-generating code has been fixed in
	gtcd (Ben C.) , and the forking of gmix has been cleaned up. (SDH)

New in 1.0.51:

	Many many bug fixes. GMix now has a rudimentary preferences dialog.
	Extace is not being maintained in this package any longer, please
	see README.extace for details. Proxy authentication for
	cddbslave/tcd.

New in 1.0.9.1:

	This release is missing extace. I could not get it working, and
	nobody seems to be supporting it anymore, so if you need it, you
	can get it from a cvs snapshot from ftp://ftp.jimpick.com/, or
	from CVS itself.

New in 1.0.9:

	TCD/Cddbslave:
	
	Now includes a --device option to specify CDROM device file.

	Lots of CDDB fixes and updates from James Henstridge, including
	extended data support and submit capability.

	Changed default CDDB server to freedb.freedb.org, since Escient are
	being dorks about their server. If you find you have a disc which is
	cataloged on cddb.cddb.com, please submit it to freedb.freedb.org.

	Gmix:

	Record selection now works.
